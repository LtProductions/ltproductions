<i><font size="5" color="white">4/20/2025 - Happy Easter/420 Day!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">In celebration of easter (and since I haven't updated the site in a month and 2 days), I added 5 new movies including the easter special for Wouldn't It Be.
   Duplicate movies in the HoF were changed to new movies aswell. Other than that, enjoy your sweet treats and have a decent day today.

<br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/18/2025 - 3d Movie Maker's 30th Anniversary</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">In 1995, Microsoft made 3d Movie Maker. It was originally a program made for kids, but it ended up sparking one of the biggest internet niches to ever exist.
     In celebration of this program turning 30, I opened up the 3DMM Hall Of Fame to the public so that y'all could see (what in my opinion) are the best movies of each decade starting in 1996. I also added 2 new themes, "Terminal" and "Bulletin Board". I highly suggest viewing the site in Bulletin Board to get the best experience for today.

    <br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/15/2025 - St Patrick's Day Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">Happy Saint Patrick's Day.... kind of. Notice how this update happened a few days before the actual day of saint patrick's day? That's because I didn't want this site theme to last for only a day.
  Anyways, I added a few new movies to the site for you to enjoy. Remember, have a nice day and wear green!
</font><br>
    <br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/14/2025 - 3.14 Day Mini Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">Happy pi day! Since it's not that big of an update (that's for st. patrick's day), I decided to only upload a few movies and nothing more. Anyways, enjoy the day today by eating pie and referencing math.</font><br>
    <br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/7/2025 - Need Movie Submissions for New Update</font></i>
    <br><font size="3" color="white">Since St. Patricks Day is coming up, I decided to make a little site theme for it. Unfortunetly though, I haven't getting any submissions for the site. So that this isn't just a site reskin, go ahead and go to the submissions page and follow the instructions there.</font><br>
    <font size="3" color="#DAA520">SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE 3/14/2025</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/3/2025 - Added Themes</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">I decided to finally make a theme for the site that actually uses the .us part of 3DMM.US. There's also a settings page on the navbar to switch between the US theme and the standard look. Enjoy this mini quality of life update.</font><br>    
<br><i><font size="5" color="white">3/1/2025 - Small Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">I designed the site so that the colors were a bit less saturated (easier on the eyes), and that every page used the same background. Expect a new update on March 7th.</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="white">2/14/2025 - Valentines Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">Happy Valentines Day! I added a few new movies to keep y'all entertained for a little bit. I'm currently working on MoonJug still and I hope it releases in March. Enjoy this little update!</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="white">1/8/2025 - Mini Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">A new update for the website! 4 new movies have been added to the site, the 3dmm.com poster links to a gallery of posters thread on 3dmm.com, and I updated some other stuff.</p><br>
<i><font size="5" color="white">1/1/2025 - New Year's Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="white">Happy New Year! The headers on every page except for the index have been changed with images, and a new movie (DAWN) has been uploaded.</font><br>
