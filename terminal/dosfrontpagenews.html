    <i><font size="5" color="#03C505">1/1/2025 - 3DMM.US NEW YEARS BASH!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Hi, I'm LT Films (Owner of 3dmm.us) and I'm delighted to say to anyone reading this blog post.. HAPPY FUCKING NEW YEAR! 3DMM.US HAS MADE IT TO 2026 AND I COULDN'T BE MORE DELIGHTED. The Digital Advent Calendar kinda fell apart because I rushed literally every day because I didn't prep ahead. But I restored everything back to normal and soon I'll update the site settings where you can choose between the 3 holiday themes that this site has had. Thank you for reading this blog post and HAPPY NEW YEAR!</font><br>
<br>
    <i><font size="5" color="#03C505">12/1/2025 - BRAND NEW ADVENT CALENDAR PAGE!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Hello ladies and gentlemen, LT Films here. I'm delighted to announce that the once-blank button now redirects to... A DIGITAL ADVENT CALENDAR! The basic idea is this, every day I update the site (specifically the advent calendar page)
with a brand new .zip download link containing a zip file of various digital xmas goods. There's already a zip file on the page itself. So what are you waiting for? GO TO THE PAGE AND DOWNLOAD IT! (I wanted to experiment on something new for the site holiday themes and I came up with this for the formerly Hall Of Fame 3dmm page.)</font><br>
<br>
<i><font size="5" color="#03C505">11/28/2025 - CHRISTMAS OVERHAUL!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Ah yes, Christmas. The last major holiday for the year. In celebration of this fine holiday, the entire site has a brand spanking new christmas theme! On new years day, the site'll go back to it's original state. Anyways, enjoy your eggnog,
  wait to unwrap your presents, and a lot of time with your family. Thanks for reading this blog post.
</font><br>

<i><font size="5" color="#03C505">11/8/2025 - Site Restored... For now.</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Since halloween is over, I changed the site back to what it was previously. Currently the guestbook is unavailible until further notice due to the fact that ultraguest doesn't like being embedded
  into other sites anymore, so I'm working on fixing that. On either the day before thanksgiving or the day of thanksgiving, or even the day after thanksgiving, I'll be changing the site to reflect that it's christmas.
  Whenever January comes around, I'll make it so that you can view the holiday themes alongside the normal site themes. Thank you for reading this blog post.

    <i><font size="5" color="#03C505">10/15/2025 - COMPLETE HALLOWEEN THEME OVERHAUL.</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Hello everyone. Lt Films here.
   Since halloween's coming up, I decided to overhaul all of 3dmm.us with a halloween theme that'll most likely last from today to November 7th, 2025. On top of there being a new theme, there will also be some new movies added relating to halloween. So go ahead and explore the site, and make sure to have a happy halloween! (P.S. Check your candy whenever you go trick or treating.)
</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">9/19/2025 - Newer Update + Hiatus.</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Wow, it's been exactly 2 months and 16 days since this since got updated. Well, I added a few new movies and some other stuff. I'm gonna be taking a hiatus from working on this site/working on 3dmm movies. I'm in a bad mindset/overall attitude and I'm gonna leave so I can regain motivation and a better mindset. Please enjoy everything that comes with this update, because there will not be another for a while. 
  Thanks to everyone who followed this site's progress and liked watching my movies, LT Films.
</font><br>
  <i><font size="5" color="#03C505">7/3/2025 - New Update!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">On this new update of 3dmm.us, there's 10 new movies and the counter got refreshed. The counter had to be refreshed because it decided to break again.
  A few examples of the new movies that were added are MoonJug, Ballistic Bellend, and 00Dee Boned: Venison Jelly.
</font><br>
    <br>
<i><font size="5" color="#03C505">5/20/2025 - New update!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">This update contains 5 new movies and a redesign of the posters page. I also decided to add a few new posters to the posters page and the counter was update to reflect
 the current visitor count for this site. Thank you for reading this blurb.
</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">5/6/2025 - Small Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">This update adds 4 new movies to the database (I usually put in 5 but I decided to not this time since I did 8 movies last update), and I redesigned the rest of the themes that previously said
  "LT PRODUCTIONS" to now say "3DMM.US". The reason for the change of layout was because I wanted to go all in on the site being named after the domain itself. 
</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">5/3/2025 - Quick Update/Beginning of May</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">So that I could get it out of the way, here's a new update to the site. It's not too much, only 8 movies but it's enough to keep the site busy until I come back with a legitimate update.
  Currently, I'm still working on Moonjug and it'll be released Summer 2025. I'm 150 scenes in as of writing this and I believe this is the best movie I've worked on this year so far.
  Anyways, watch the movies I added and have a good day.
</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">4/20/2025 - Happy Easter/420 Day!</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">In celebration of easter (and since I haven't updated the site in a month and 2 days), I added 5 new movies including the easter special for Wouldn't It Be.
   Duplicate movies in the HoF were changed to new movies aswell. Other than that, enjoy your sweet treats and have a decent day today.
</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">3/18/2025 - 3d Movie Maker's 30th Anniversary</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">In 1995, Microsoft made 3d Movie Maker. It was originally a program made for kids, but it ended up sparking one of the biggest internet niches to ever exist.
     In celebration of this program turning 30, I opened up the 3DMM Hall Of Fame to the public so that y'all could see (what in my opinion) are the best movies of each decade starting in 1996. I also added 2 new themes, "Terminal" and "Bulletin Board". I highly suggest viewing the site in Bulletin Board to get the best experience for today.
</font><br>
    <br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">3/15/2025 - St Patrick's Day Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Happy Saint Patrick's Day.... kind of. Notice how this update happened a few days before the actual day of saint patrick's day? That's because I didn't want this site theme to last for only a day.
  Anyways, I added a few new movies to the site for you to enjoy. Remember, have a nice day and wear green!
</font><br>
    <br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">3/14/2025 - 3.14 Day Mini Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Happy pi day! Since it's not that big of an update (that's for st. patrick's day), I decided to only upload a few movies and nothing more. Anyways, enjoy the day today by eating pie and referencing math.</font><br>
    <br><i><font size="5" color="#049606">3/7/2025 - Need Movie Submissions for New Update</font></i>
    <br><font size="3" color="#049606">Since St. Patricks Day is coming up, I decided to make a little site theme for it. Unfortunetly though, I haven't getting any submissions for the site. So that this isn't just a site reskin, go ahead and go to the submissions page and follow the instructions there.</font><br>
    <font size="3" color="#DAA520">SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE 3/14/2025</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">3/3/2025 - Added Themes</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">I decided to finally make a theme for the site that actually uses the .us part of 3DMM.US. There's also a settings page on the navbar to switch between the US theme and the standard look. Enjoy this mini quality of life update.</font><br>    
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">3/1/2025 - Small Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">I designed the site so that the colors were a bit less saturated (easier on the eyes), and that every page used the same background. Expect a new update on March 7th.</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">2/14/2025 - Valentines Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Happy Valentines Day! I added a few new movies to keep y'all entertained for a little bit. I'm currently working on MoonJug still and I hope it releases in March. Enjoy this little update!</font><br>
<br><i><font size="5" color="#03C505">1/8/2025 - Mini Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">A new update for the website! 4 new movies have been added to the site, the 3dmm.com poster links to a gallery of posters thread on 3dmm.com, and I updated some other stuff.</p><br>
<i><font size="5" color="#03C505">1/1/2025 - New Year's Update</font></i>
<br><font size="3" color="#049606">Happy New Year! The headers on every page except for the index have been changed with images, and a new movie (DAWN) has been uploaded.</font><br>
