    <p>The <STRONG>LT FILMS</STRONG> website was established in 2022 by Lt Films, originally on a neocities domain.</p>
    <p>After a year of being hosted on NeoCities, the site was redesigned and ported over to ltfilms.ml (Now a dead domain).</p>
    <p>After several months away from the site and 3dmm in general, ltfilms.ml shut down because the .ml extension got removed.</p>
    <p>On December 3rd 2024, the site was reborn and it started as another NeoCities domain. Then the code got sent over to github pages (its current host).</p>
    <p>After a while, the site went from a long domain to just 3dmm.us.</p>
  <strong><center><p>BELOW ARE SCREENSHOTS OF THE SITE OVER THE YEARS, WITH VARYING DESIGNS.</p></center></strong>

  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/n2e89z.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/n2e89z.png" alt="V1" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>This was the first look of the website. It wasn't pleasant on the eyes at all, but it has the first version of the navbar that was around up until now.</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3to35v.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/3to35v.png" alt="V2" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>The second version of the website. It went under the name of ltfilms.ml in 2023 - early 2024 (whenever it shut down). It still used that rudimentary navbar code. <a href="https://ltproduct10ns.neocities.org"> Visit Here! (With stuff changed.)</a></p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/328r56.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/328r56.png" alt="V3" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>The third version of the website. I restarted it back in december 2024 and I decided to change out the navbar design because it was getting old.</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/13kswc.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/13kswc.png" alt="V4" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>The current look of the site. I redesigned practically everything and I made every page have the same background. I love purple so I made that the main color theme of the site. This is the standard look for the site.</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/q059rl.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/q059rl.png" alt="V4.5" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>Same design as above, but more "Patriotized". A lot of people asked for this site to have an American design after the domain was obtained. Theme is called "USA".</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/yz3d1g.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/yz3d1g.png" alt="V4.5" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>Whenever I added themes to the site on 3/3/2025, this was one of the first themes besides the US theme that I wanted to implement into the site. I've always had a love for the old internet (circa the late 90s and early-to-mid 2000s) and this theme reflects that in its web 1.0 like glory. Theme is called "90s".</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/oehmev.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/oehmev.png" alt="V4.5" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>Whenever 3d Movie Maker reached its 30 year anniversary, I decided to make this theme for the site based off of the old look of the 3dmm bulletin board circa like 2002-2004. It's kind of ugly but that ugliness (in my opinion) adds charm to the theme itself. The day in which this was dropped was when the 3DMM Hall of Fame was added to the site. Theme is called "Bulletin Board".</p><br></center>
    <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/0thoxt.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/0thoxt.png" alt="V4.5" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>This theme, lovingly called "terminal", was released on the same day as the Bulletin Board theme and is based off of old DOS terminals and the terminals from the fallout games. It even uses sounds from fallout for the hover and select sounds!</p><br></center>
  <center><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3eci8u.png"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/3eci8u.png" alt="V4.5" style="width:352px;height:144px;"></a><br></center>
  <center><br><p>Dark Mode is the newest theme on the site and is my favorite theme (besides the standard one) due to how kind of simplistic it is alongside how functional it really is. It's based off of how Steam looked in the early 2010s.</p><br></center>
  <center><div class="foot3r" size="36px">|This is every version of the 3DMM.US site (for now). Stick around for more themes/appearances to be added to this page.|</div></center>
