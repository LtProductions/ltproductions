    <p>The <STRONG>LT FILMS</STRONG> website was established in 2022 by Lt Films, originally on a neocities domain.</p>
    <p>After a year of being hosted on NeoCities, the site was redesigned and ported over to ltfilms.ml (Now a dead domain).</p>
    <p>After several months away from the site and 3dmm in general, ltfilms.ml shut down because the .ml extension got removed.</p>
    <p>On December 3rd 2024, the site was reborn and it started as another NeoCities domain. Then the code got sent over to github pages (its current host).</p>
    <p>After a while, the site went from a long domain to just 3dmm.us.</p>
  <strong><center><p>BELOW ARE SCREENSHOTS OF THE SITE OVER THE YEARS, WITH VARYING DESIGNS.</p></center></strong>

  <img src="./Site_Images/sitescreens/age1.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;"><br>
  <br><p>This was the first look of the website. It wasn't pleasant on the eyes at all, but it has the first version of the navbar that's still around today.</p><br>
  <img src="./Site_Images/sitescreens/age2.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;"><br>
  <br><p>The second version of the website. It went under the name of ltfilms.ml in 2023 - early 2024 (whenever it shut down). It still has that navbar look it rocks today.</p><br>
  <img src="./Site_Images/sitescreens/age3.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;"><br>
  <br><p>The current version of the website. I restarted it back in december 2024 and I decided to keep the way the navbar is since it's tride and true.</p><br>
  <center><footer>THIS IS EVERY VERSION OF THE SITE (For now), stick around for more looks to be put into here.</footer></center>
