<i><font size="4">3/1/2025 - Small Update</font></i><br>
<p>I designed the site so that the colors were a bit less saturated (easier on the eyes), and that every page used the same background. Expect a new update on March 7th.</p><br>
<i><font size="4">2/14/2025 - Valentines Update!</font></i><br>
Happy Valentines Day! I added a few new movies to keep y'all entertained for a little bit. I'm working on a new website (that isn't gonna kill this one) with 2 other people. Enjoy this little update!</p><br>
<i><font size="4">1/8/2025 - Mini Update</font></i>
<p>A new update for the website! 4 new movies have been added to the site, the 3dmm.com poster links to a gallery of posters thread on 3dmm.com, and I updated some other stuff.</p><br>
<i><font size="4">1/1/2025 - New Year's Update</font></i>
<p>Happy New Year! The headers on every page except for the index have been changed with images, and a new movie (DAWN) has been uploaded.</p><br>
